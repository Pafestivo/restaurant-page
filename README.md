# restaurant-page
Building a demo restaurant page with the use of webpack.<br>
A lot of time and effort was spent into the learning process of the subject, through this project.<br>
I've been documenting the learning process using commits - Each commits shows a new feature i've learned.<br>
The live demo of this page can be found here - <br>https://pafestivo.github.io/restaurant-page/
